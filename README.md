# Bell's Inequalities 

Experiment using Bell's Inequalities on both classical and quantum bits. 

Probabilities consist of hashes `VV, VH, HV, and HH`

The experiment was done with both classical and quantum bits, and was found that the Qc bits don't obey the CHSH Inequality.

Thus, CHSH Inequality that proves true for classical bits breaks down for qubits.
